      <description>or &amp;ldquo;how to not be stupid with your inserts&amp;rdquo; I&#39;m working on a small side project where I&#39;m consuming public listing data from an API for fun and profit. The API will allow me to GET the newest items corresponding to a specific query, and paginates at a maximum page size of 50.
I store all listings that I&#39;ve already seen in Postgres for later analysis but due to the nature of the API, I&#39;m unable to pull only new listings and have to resort to somehow decide whether or not I should continue paginating.</description>

      <description>Do you remember how everybody was hyped about the new date and time APIs introduced in Java 8? Yes, I was hyped too, although I was using jodatime wherever I could anyway. Now this was a while back and at the time of this writing, Java 10 is out and the latest (or at least a fairly current) release is
java version &amp;quot;10.0.1&amp;quot; 2018-04-17 Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.3 (build 10.</description>

      <description>My employer agreed on buying me a new and shiny MacBook Pro, so I thought it’s a good time to reflect on my experiences with using ElementaryOS (Freya) professionally daily driver for almost a year.
TL;DR I mostly enjoyed the ride. Elementary is fast, polished, functional and has outstanding multi-monitor support. On the other hand, it’s still a Linux and the desktop experience is not nearly as polished as on MacOS and Windows.</description>
